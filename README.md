# 🪡 SEWNA — Connect with Independent Designers

**SEWNA** is a platform that helps people connect with independent designers to create custom designs.  
This project reimagines SEWNA’s **Welcome Page** and introduces two interactive user flows:  
1. **Designer Registration & Portfolio Upload**  
2. **Designer Discovery & Selection**

## ✨ Features  

### 🧵 1. I am a Designer  
When a designer clicks **“I am a Designer”**, they are presented with a **registration form** to:  
- Create a designer profile  
- Upload portfolio projects (images + descriptions)  
- Specify their specialities and style preferences  

This feature helps designers build credibility and visibility on SEWNA.

### 👗 2. I need a Designer  
When a client clicks **“I need a Designer”**, they are taken to a **Designer Discovery Page**, where they can:  
- Browse available designers  
- Filter or sort by **speciality**  
- Search designers by name or tag  
- Click on profiles to view **designer portfolios** and **client reviews**  

This creates a seamless and inspiring experience for users seeking custom design services.

## 🧠 Product Thinking  

I chose these two flows because they represent SEWNA’s **core connection point** — where designers and clients meet.  
- For designers: the goal is to **encourage self-expression** and make their work shine.  
- For clients: the goal is to **inspire trust and excitement** through a smooth discovery process.  

I wanted users to feel **warmth, confidence, and creative energy** — like working with a trusted designer who understands their vision.
